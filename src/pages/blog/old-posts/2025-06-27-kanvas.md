As engineers, we often live in YAML, Dockerfiles, Terraform modules, and Helm charts. We design infrastructure with the precision of a surgeon—yet somehow, collaboration around this infrastructure feels like medieval surgery. Messy. Manual. Painful.

When I first got a look at **Layer5 Kanvas** ([docs](https://docs.layer5.io/kanvas)), I felt like I was stepping into the future.

### **The Problem We All Know Too Well**

DevOps tooling is powerful, but let’s be honest: it’s not collaborative. Tools like Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform are optimized for automation and scale—but not for human collaboration. When you need to work on infra-as-code with someone else, the workflow looks like this:

* Open VS Code.
* Share a screen on Zoom.
* Hope your teammate understands your tab indentation religion.
* Commit.
* Push.
* Wait for CI.
* Realize someone’s change clobbered yours.

What’s worse: visual tools *exist*, but they’re often read-only, over-simplified, or disconnected from your real codebase. That’s not collaboration—that’s compromise.

### **Enter Kanvas: DevOps Meets Multiplayer Design**

Kanvas is **Google Docs for infrastructure and Kubernetes ops**—but it’s more than that.

Kanvas provides a **real-time, multiplayer canvas** where engineers, platform teams, and even product folks can collaborate visually *and* operationally. You’re not looking at diagrams that get stale in 2 hours. You’re working on live deployments, live configurations, and live environments. It’s WYSIWYG for infrastructure.

### **What Makes Kanvas Different**

* **Live Infra Modeling**: Drag-and-drop Kubernetes resources, service meshes, policies, cloud services—all modeled in real time.
* **Source of Truth Integration**: Connect Kanvas to your GitHub repo, Helm charts, or Terraform modules. Edits on the canvas can sync back to code, so you’re never out of sync.
* **Multi-user Collaboration**: Just like Figma or Google Docs, you see who’s on the canvas, who’s editing what, and you can co-edit clusters and workloads live.
* **Context-Rich Views**: Hover on a service, and you don’t get a static label—you get live logs, metrics, config diffs, and Git blame.
* **Simulation & Preview**: Want to see the effect of scaling a deployment or adding a policy? Simulate before committing.

### **Use Cases I Love**

* **Platform Teams & SREs**: When designing multi-tenant infra or onboarding new microservices, Kanvas acts like a collaborative control tower.
* **Developer Enablement**: Developers can explore and tweak their service deployments without digging through thousands of lines of YAML.
* **Architectural Reviews**: In our team, we use Kanvas to run infra reviews the same way designers run Figma critiques.

### **Under the Hood**

If you're curious about the tech (I always am), Kanvas is built with:

* **Kubernetes-native APIs**, using Layer5's own Meshery as the execution engine.
* **WebAssembly-based modeling**, making the frontend fast and powerful.
* **CRD sync and diffing**, so you can compare what’s in Git vs. what’s in your cluster.

### **The Future Is Composable, Visual, and Multiplayer**

Kanvas isn’t just about pretty visuals. It’s about operational clarity. It's about making infrastructure a *shared experience*—not just a shell script behind a CI pipeline.

If you’ve ever struggled with team onboarding, infra reviews, or debugging a broken service mesh deployment, you know the pain. Kanvas brings **order to the chaos**—with the intelligence of a DevOps tool and the usability of a design platform.

We built Kanvas because we were tired of juggling a dozen tools just to understand one deployment. It’s still early, but I’m genuinely excited about what’s coming next.

**TL;DR:**
Kanvas is multiplayer DevOps. Real-time collaboration, infra-as-code fidelity, and visual context—all in one canvas. Try it. Break it. Build with it. And let us know what you think.
